First we must install the headers, this is done manually (this is because the normal way does not work), here is the link where you can download them [Resource](https://http.kali.org/kali/pool/main/l/linux/)

The packages we need will depend on the version, in my case I have the:

*5.10.0-kali9-amd64*

You can see the version with the command:

```bash
uname -r
```

The packages are:

* linux-headers-5.10.0-kali9-amd64_5.10.46-1kali1_amd64.deb
* linux-headers-5.10.0-kali9-common_5.10.46-1kali1_all.deb
* linux-kbuild-5.10_5.10.46-4kali1_amd64.deb

We install them with the command: 

```bash
dpkg -i <Paquete>
```

The order of the packages is:

1 - linux-headers-5.10.0-kali9-common_5.10.46-1kali1_all.deb

2 - inux-kbuild-5.10_5.10.46-4kali1_amd64.deb

3 - linux-headers-5.10.0-kali9-amd64_5.10.46-1kali1_amd64.deb

To download the packages we can use wget or directly from the web.

This will take some time, so be patient on this part. I make this article because it gave me a lot of problems when installing this, then I found a solution that was very useful.

I hope you find it useful.
